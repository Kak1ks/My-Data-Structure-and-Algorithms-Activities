Student Grade Management System
A Java console application utilizing a heap structure to manage student grades. It simulates a grade management system, prioritizing students by grade average.

Functionality
1. Add Student: Adds students with name, grades, and average.
2. Display Top Student: Removes and displays the student with the highest average.
3. Display Students: Lists all students with their averages.
4. Search Student: Searches by name.
5. Exit: Terminates the application.

Why I Made This Application
I created this application to: Demonstrate heap structure usage in real-world scenarios. Develop problem-solving skills in data structures and algorithms. Provide a simple, intuitive grade management system.

Contribution to Community
This application contributes to the community by: Offering an open-source grade management system. Serving as an educational resource for heap structure implementation. Providing a basic template for larger grade management systems.

//Phonebook Application
This application is a simple phonebook that allows users to store and retrieve contact information using a hash table.
Functionality
- Add a new contact with a name and phone number
- Search for a contact by name and retrieve their phone number
- Delete a contact by name
- Display all contacts in the phonebook

Why I Made This Application
I made this application to demonstrate a practical use of hash tables in a real-world scenario. Phonebooks are a common use case for hash tables, as they require fast lookup and insertion of contact information.

How This Application Contributes to Me or the Community
This application contributes to me by helping me develop my skills in designing and implementing hash table-based data structures. It also contributes to the community by providing a simple and easy-to-understand

//Banking System Application
This is a simple banking system that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, transfer funds between accounts, check balances, and view transaction history.

Functionality
-Create Account: Set up a new account with an account number, name, and initial balance.
- Deposit Funds: Add money to an account.
- Withdraw Funds: Withdraw money from an account, with balance checks.
- Transfer Funds: Send money between accounts.
- Check Balance: View the current balance of an account.
- Transaction History: Display a record of all transactions.

Why I Made This Application
This application was created to demonstrate basic banking operations and practice Java programming concepts like object-oriented design, collections, and exception handling.

//What is it?  
The Directed Graph with DFS is a simple Java program that shows how to use a directed graph. It stores the graph's vertices and edges in a list and lets you perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the graph.

What can it do?  

1. Add a Vertex: Add a new point (vertex) to the graph.  
2. Add a Edge: Create a one-way connection (edge) between two vertices.  
3.DFS Traversal: Start at any vertex and use Depth-First Search to explore all connected vertices.  
4. Display Graph: Show the graph with all the vertices and their outgoing edges.  
5. Exit: Close the program.

Why did I make it?  

I created this program to practice coding with graph structures and learn how Depth-First Search works in Java. It also helps me understand how graphs can be represented and explored using code.

How does it help?  

For me: It helped me practice Java and understand graph algorithms better.  
For others: It's a simple tool for beginners to learn how graphs and DFS work in a hands-on way. Itâ€™s easy to understand and can be a good starting point for learning more advanced topics.
